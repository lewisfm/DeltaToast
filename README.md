# DeltaToast

> Shows you what's currently playing, just like that one time DELTARUNE did it!

This is the unofficial Mac Port of DeltaTune. It should work with any music app (e.g. Apple Music, Spotify)!

I recommend setting this as a login app so it starts when you turn on your computer.

If you open the app when it's already running you can access the settings.

Also, check out the original (this is where I got the assets from):

## Settings

There are a good amount of settings for you to choose from!
